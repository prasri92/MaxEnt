## Sparse Data -- Maximum Entropy

Code is in Python2 as some of libraries used do not support Python3.

### Python libs used:

- `numpy`, `scipy` (for the L-BFGS-B optimization module)
- `pyitlib` for discrete random vairable entropy calculations

### Notes

All the discussion notes along with the todo lists and things to try out
are in the `report-maxent.md`markdown file. 

Create a pdf (using pdflatex and pandoc) from the markdown file:
`pandoc report.md -o report.pdf`

The actual report starts at the very end with the appropriate sections
