# Report

## Notes for report

-   Dealing with data sparsity -- maxent approach

-   entropy estimation topics
    -   try out other entropy estimators and compare performance
-   use of L measure -- normalization, top co-variate selection
    -   selecting the top feature pairs
-   Partitioning of features into compartments -- transitive closure and
    connected components in a graph
    -   approximate partitions
-   optimization, convex, numerical methods
    -   iterative scaling vs lbfgsb
-   Market basket analysis to see relevant diseases

-   Experiments, Plots etc

-   Contribute to `pyitlib` library (bonus points!)

-   New possible insights into the problem
