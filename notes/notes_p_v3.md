Problems to look into now 
1. Gurobi scale for 15 diseases - takes 3 hours for each, gurobi in compute cloud takes too long 
2. Regularization expt (2.1) - 
2.1 jensen shannon divergence is the only metric which works because we see that there are a lot of probabilities that are exactly 0. 
2.2 In the case of 10 diseases, we see that actually regularized curve is performning worse than the unregularized curve 
3.
